# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore master cryptographic key
/config/master.key

# Ignore credentials
# In theory, these should be safe in version control since they are encrypted,
# but since the credentials will be different in different deployments, they should
# stay out of version control.
/config/credentials.yml.enc

# Ignore environment variables
/config/local_env.yml

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
